## Overview
Parking on campus can be difficult, even impossible sometimes to find a stall. With this webpage, students and faculty can preview various parking locations before spending time trying to drive around and park in that area. Users can mark the amount of open stalls in any given parking zone, allowing other users to access those parking stalls and mark them as taken once they have parked.

## Mockup Page Ideas
# Home Page Landing page/ Sign-In Page
# User Page Profiles/Parking Permits & Zones/Credibility
# Admin Page
# Parking Map

## Use Case Ideas
New user goes to landing page, Sign-In/Sign-Up for profile

Admin signs into landing page, edits site

User goes to parking map to view available stalls or mark stalls as available

Users finding parking can mark stalls as taken once they have been occupied

Users/Admin provide realtime updates to parking zones

Users/Admin can report false information

## Beyond the Basics
Allow differentiation between stall types

Track statistics and frequency of stall usage

Rating system for user credibility

Filter system for UH Users only
