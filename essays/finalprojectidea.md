## Overview
Parking on campus can be difficult, even impossible sometimes to find a stall. With this webpage, students and faculty can preview various parking locations before spending time trying to drive around and park in that area. Users can mark the amount of open stalls in any given parking zone, allowing other users to access those parking stalls and mark them as taken once they have parked.

## Mockup Page Ideas
# Home Page Landing page/ Sign-In Page
# User Page Profiles/Parking Permits & Zones/Credibility
# Admin Page
# Parking Map

## Use Case Ideas
With the practice of this course being athletic software engineering, I believe that this should be stressed. Working out without focusing on form yields much less results and benefits than practicing proper form over repetition. I believe the same goes for coding. Bad coding practice can definitely impact your ability to learn a new coding language. Following the standards definitely makes you think twice and check over your work more often, causing the syntax and usage of different functions and in turn, helps you to learn the different nuances of the language you are trying to learn.

## Beyond the Basics
Coding standards can be tough sometimes. Then again, nothing worth doing in the end will be easy in the beginning is something that I live by. Holding yourself to a standard will eventually cause that to become second nature to you. ESLint has helped me to begin that path towards maintaining that standard in my coding practice. Whether it's through making me work with ESLint to make that green check mark appear, or having the coding standards template reformat my messy code as I go along, I believe that it's constant and consistent progress. In the end, it's definitely worth it to practice and follow standards.
