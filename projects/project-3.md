Arnold Air Society is a professional, honorary, service organization advocating the support of aerospace power. I joined the program in the first semester of my ROTC career at UH Manoa. Since then I have moved through many different operational positions throughout the squadron. In doing so, I eventually ran to be elected as the Squadron Commander for the Lieutenant Colonel Horace Meek Hickam Squadron at the Detachment.

I am now in charge of managing the daily operations of the squadron as well as serving as the link between the higher levels of command and the other Cadets that I work with. We are currently in the process of organizing a region wide meeting known as the Area Conclave which will be held in Hawaii in October 2018. There are many preparations being made, and as a result I have had to serve as a major link in the chain of communication between my Squadron and the Area Staff above me.

To add to my duties, this semester will also involve a Candidate Class in which Cadets interested in joining Arnold Air Society will have their mettle and resilience tested through a 10-week period of training. During this time I am responsible for overseeing the effective and appropriate training of the new candidates. I will serve as their mentor and leadership image to look towards, and as a result has made me improve my leadership skills and my overall personality in order to fit that role more effectively.
